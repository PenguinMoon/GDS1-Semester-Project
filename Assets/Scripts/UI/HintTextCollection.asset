  hints:
  - The Flamethrower turret is great for defending against big crowds of enemies.
  - Not all turrets are held equal. Holding turrets with shorter attack ranges and
    confronting enemies up close can be the best strategy.
  - Some enemies deal more damage to the workshop than others. Beware of the boss
    enemies as they deal the most damage!
  - The Cannon turret is best placed far back due to its low fire rate and long attack
    range.
  - Don't forget to place your turrets down to give the Builder's arms a rest! You
    can only recharge the turret with batteries if its placed down.
  - Unlocking Objectives is the key to victory. Opting to defend with just the starting
    turret is basically just hard mode!
  - Never give up! Failure is just another step towards success.
  - If you ever run out of space, recycle a turret at the bin and regain some bits
    and circuits. Recycle and reuse!
  - Remember to save some bits for crafting batteries, or else you'll be in trouble!
  - just don't lose lmao
  - Want to play with a friend? Just plug in a controller, press any controller button
    and your friend will be there!
  - Sometimes unlocking every objective on a level will put you at an disadvantage.
    Saving up your bits and circuits for only a few objectives can be a better strategy.
  - Sometimes taking a break from the game is just what you need to pass that one
    level you just can't seem to beat.
